# About
Pinwheel is made to be customizable in any way possible. This includes the 64 colors of the system.  
This repository contains a color palette for Pinwheel to use in all (if not most) situations.  
*The cases where it isn't used is when the program provides one.*

The palettes are defined in the [Pinwheel Palette format](FileFormat.md) (`.pwp`).
